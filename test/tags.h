// The following tags are intended to be used as the second argument to the
// TEST_CASE macros of catch2. You can easily combine tags by using multiple
// tag macros separated by whitespace, e.g., if TAG_A is "[a]" and TAG_B is
// "[b]", then TAG_A TAG_B is "[a]" "[b]", which is equivalent to "[a][b]".
