# The DAPHNE System

### Overview

"The DAPHNE project aims to define and build an open and extensible system infrastructure for integrated data analysis pipelines, including data management and processing, high-performance computing (HPC), and machine learning (ML) training and scoring." (more information on https://daphne-eu.eu/)

In this repository, we develop the whole DAPHNE system with all its components including, but not limited to *DaphneDSL*, *DaphneLib*, *DaphneIR*, the *DAPHNE Compiler*, and the *DAPHNE Run-time*.
The system will be built up and extended gradually in the course of the project.
